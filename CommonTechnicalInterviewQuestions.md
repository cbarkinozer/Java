**Backend Questions**<br/>
<br/>
**What is Backend?**<br/>
The part of a computer system or application that is not directly accessed by the user, typically responsible for storing and manipulating data.<br/>
<br/>
**What are the differences between backend and frontend?**<br/>
Frontend refers to the client-side, whereas backend refers to the server-side of the application<br/>
<br/>
**What is multilayered arcihtecture on Backend?**<br/>
Multi layered applications consists of multiple layers, each of which corresponds for a different specific responsibility. Separating the layers and responsibilities in this way makes it very easy to develop and maintain the application.<br/>
<br/>
**What is a web server?**<br/>
A web server is a computer that runs websites. The basic objective of the web server is to store, process and deliver web pages to the users. This intercommunication is done using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
<br/>
**What are the communication protocols?**<br/>
A communication protocol is a system of rules that allows two or more entities of a communications system to transmit information via any kind of variation of a physical quantity. The protocol defines the rules, syntax, semantics and synchronization of communication and possible error recovery methods.<br/>
<br/>
**How Socket works?**<br/>
A socket is one endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network. A socket is bound to a port number so that the TCP layer can identify the application that data is destined to be sent to. An endpoint is a combination of an IP address and a port number.<br/>
<br/>
**What is HTTP?**<br/>
The Hypertext Transfer Protocol is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems that allows users to communicate data on the World Wide Web.<br/>
<br/>
**What are database types?**<br/>
Centralized Database (low risk of management,cheaper,better data quality|large,high ping, hard to update, server failure risk cost high)<br/>
Distributed Database(servers communicate with each other,server failure will not affect, modular developement is possible)<br/>
Relational Database(ACID properties atomicity,consistency,isolation,durability)<br/>
NoSQL Database(storing data in non-structured format, better for managing and handling large, highly scalable, qucik access)<br/>
Cloud Database(virtual environment, many services such as SaaS, PaaS, IaaS)<br/>
Object-oriented Databases(data is stored as objects)<br/>
Hierarchical Databases(form of parent-children relationship nodes)<br/>
Network Databases(form of parent-children relationship nodes)<br/>
Personal Database(Collecting and storing data on the user's system.Easy,small,simple)<br/>
Operational Database(creates and updates the database in real-time)<br/>
Enterprise Database(used by enterprises,large,multi process,parallel queries)<br/>
<br/>
**What are the differences between RDBMS and NoSql?**<br/>
RDBMS applications store data in the form of table structured manner. NoSQL is a non-relational database system. NoSQL uses to store data in structured, semi-structured and unstructured forms.<br/>
<br/>
**What is a monolithic system?**<br/>
In software engineering, a monolithic application describes a single-tiered software application in which the user interface and data access code are combined into a single program from a single platform.<br/>

**What is microservice structure and how it works?**<br/>
Microservices are an architectural approach to creating cloud applications. When using microservices, you isolate software functionality into multiple independent modules that are individually responsible for performing precisely defined, standalone tasks. These modules communicate with each other through simple, universally accessible application programming interfaces (APIs).<br/>

**What is SOA(service oriented architecture)?**<br/>
SOA, or service-oriented architecture, defines a way to make software components reusable and interoperable via service interfaces. Services use common interface standards and !
an architectural pattern so they can be rapidly incorporated into new applications.<br/>
