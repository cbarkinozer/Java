**What is a web server?**<br/>
A web server is a computer that runs websites. The basic objective of the web server is to store, process and deliver web pages to the users. This intercommunication is done using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
**What are the communication protocols?**<br/>
A communication protocol is a system of rules that allows two or more entities of a communications system to transmit information via any kind of variation of a physical quantity. The protocol defines the rules, syntax, semantics and synchronization of communication and possible error recovery methods.<br/>
**How Socket works?**<br/>
A socket is one endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network. A socket is bound to a port number so that the TCP layer can identify the application that data is destined to be sent to. An endpoint is a combination of an IP address and a port number.<br/>
**What is HTTP?**<br/>
The Hypertext Transfer Protocol is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems that allows users to communicate data on the World Wide Web.<br/>
**What are database types?**<br/>
Centralized Database (low risk of management,cheaper,better data quality|large,high ping, hard to update, server failure risk cost high)<br/>
Distributed Database(servers communicate with each other,server failure will not affect, modular developement is possible)<br/>
Relational Database(ACID properties atomicity,consistency,isolation,durability)<br/>
NoSQL Database(storing data in non-structured format, better for managing and handling large, highly scalable, qucik access)<br/>
Cloud Database(virtual environment, many services such as SaaS, PaaS, IaaS)<br/>
Object-oriented Databases(data is stored as objects)<br/>
Hierarchical Databases(form of parent-children relationship nodes)<br/>
Network Databases(form of parent-children relationship nodes)<br/>
Personal Database(Collecting and storing data on the user's system.Easy,small,simple)<br/>
Operational Database(creates and updates the database in real-time)<br/>
Enterprise Database(used by enterprises,large,multi process,parallel queries)<br/>
