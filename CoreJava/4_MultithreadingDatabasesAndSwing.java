//Multithreading and Concurrency
/*
       Concurrency is the simultaneous occurrence of events working at the same time.
       Process is every different application running concurrently.
       Every process has its own memory space in memory, threads share memory space.
       Thread is different operations on an application running concurrently.
       Every program has 1 process and 1 thread in that process.
       Multithreading is faster, gives an opportunity of doing multiple operations but it is harder to program, test,debug.
