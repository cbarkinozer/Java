# SpringBootcamp
I create documentation by researching topics in Softtech & Patika Java Spring Bootcamp.  
Although I do not use the notes of the lecturer directly, I add his notes therefore many thanks to the teacher Sadık Bahadır Memiş.  
Other web-based sources are used directly without paraphrasing, paraphrasing is planned for the future.  
Topics: Spring, Rest, Database, Security, Testing, CI/CD.
