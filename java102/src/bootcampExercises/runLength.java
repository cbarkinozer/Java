Run Length
Have the function RunLength(str) take the str parameter being passed and return a compressed version of the string using the Run-length encoding algorithm.
This algorithm works by taking the occurrence of each repeating character and outputting that number along with a single character of the repeating sequence.
For example: "wwwggopp" would return 3w2g1o2p. The string will not contain any numbers, punctuation, or symbols.
Examples
Input: "aabbcde"
Output: 2a2b1c1d1e
Input: "wwwbbbw"
Output: 3w3b1w
