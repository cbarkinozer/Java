For a given array of transactions, group all of the transactions by item name. Return an array of strings where each string contains the item name followed by
a space and the number of associated transactions.
Note: Sort the array descending by transactions count, then ascending alphabetically by item name for items with matching transaction counts.
Example:
transactions=["notebook","notebook","mouse","keyboard","mouse"]
There are 2 items with 2 transactions each:
The notebook and mouse in alphabetical order they are mouse notebook.
There is 1 item with 1 transaction: keyboard.
The return array sorted as required is ["mouse 2", "keyboard 2", "notebook 1"]
