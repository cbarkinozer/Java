An e-commerce site tracks the purchases made each day. The product that is purchased the most one day is the featured product for the following day.
If there is a tie for the product purchased most frequently, those product names are ordered alphabetically ascending and the last name in the list is chosen.
Example
products=["redShirt","greenPants","redShirt","orangeShoes","blackPants","blackPants"]
redShirt and blackPants are ordered 2 times in that day. So products are ordered alphabetically.
redShirt is the last product listed so it is selected.
Function has a string products[n] array. 1<= n <=10^4.
Function should return selected product as a string.
