Level:MEDIUM
Have the function LetterCount(str) take the str parameter being passed and return the first word with the greatest number of repeated letters.
For example: "Today, is the greatest day ever!" should return greatest because it has 2 e's (and 2 t's) and it comes before ever which also has 2 e's.
If there are no words with repeating letters return -1. Words will be separated by spaces.
Examples
Input: "Hello apple pie"
Output: Hello
Input: "No words"
Output: -1
