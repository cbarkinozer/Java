A square of squares
You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!
However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.
Task
Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:
In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.
The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.
Examples
-1  =>  false
 0  =>  true
 3  =>  false
 4  =>  true
25  =>  true
26  =>  false

//This takes long time with large data
import java.util.stream.IntStream;

public class Square {    
    public static boolean isSquare(int n) {
      
      if (n==0){
        return true;
      }
      
        return IntStream.rangeClosed(1, n)
                .filter(x -> x * x == n)
                .findFirst()
                .isPresent();
    }
}

//Use this instead:

public class Square {    
    public static boolean isSquare(int n) {
      
        if (n < 0) {
            return false;
        }
        
        int sqrt = (int) Math.sqrt(n);
        return sqrt * sqrt == n;
      }
}
