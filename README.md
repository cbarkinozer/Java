# JavaProjects
Java projects that I made to learn the Java language.<br/>
I used Eclipse IDE, I do not use anymore. I prefer NetBeans IDE for desktop developement and Intellij IDE for other java developement (like web) because it is more begineer-friendly.<br/>
Origin branch is the default branch. I push updates on master branch than pull to the origin branch.<br/>

### Notes
Java code files have .java extension and they are first compiled to bytecodes that have .class extensions. <br/>
Than these bytecodes are interpreted in the JVM (Java virtual machine) that is special for every different OS. <br/>
So Java becomes "Write Once Run Everywhere". <br/>
JVM's come with JRE(Java runtime environment) that is used for running java applications. <br/>
JRE's come with JDK (Java Developement Kit) that is a library for developing java applications. <br/>

main() method must be in the Main class and program starts from this Main() method. <br/>
A project without a main() method can not be run. <br/>
